### Hi there! I'm Ritika 
 Cyber Guardian | Analytics Wizard | Data Enthusiast 

 Securing the cloud, hunting threats, and automating defenses.
Hi, Iâ€™m Ritika Nathani, a cybersecurity enthusiast and DevSecOps practitioner with a Masterâ€™s in Management Information Systems from Baruch College. I specialize in cloud security, threat hunting, incident response, and automated monitoring across environments like GCP and AWS.
Iâ€™ve reduced network exposure, strengthened IAM policies, and developed real-time alert systems to catch vulnerabilities before they become incidents. My hands-on toolkit includes Python, SIEM tools (Splunk), IDS/IPS, DAST & SAST tools, and CI/CD automation, all aimed at making systems resilient and secure.
From analyzing legacy applications against CVEs and OWASP Top 10, to managing production security incidents with PagerDuty, I thrive on protecting systems, mitigating risks, and improving security postures.

Outside work, I run cybersecurity labs, lead security competitions, and experiment with new defense strategies, always learning the next way to stay ahead of attackers.

Focus Areas: Cloud Security | Threat Hunting | Incident Response | Network Defense | Security Automation | Vulnerability Management | Compliance & GRC | Python & Security Tooling
